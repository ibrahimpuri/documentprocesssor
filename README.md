DocumentProcessing Application
This repository contains a Flask-based web application for processing various types of documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The application leverages Docker and AWS services (ECR, ECS, Fargate) for deployment and scalability.

Features

Document Ingestion: Accepts multiple types of documents (invoices, medical reports, news articles) via a simple web interface.
NLP Processing: Utilizes SpaCy for advanced text extraction and named entity recognition.
Automated Information Gathering: Integrates with external APIs (e.g., FDA for drug information) to enrich extracted data.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Provides insights through data analysis and visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly.
Scalable Deployment: Designed for deployment on AWS ECS with Fargate, ensuring scalability and minimal manual intervention.
Logging and Error Handling: Implements comprehensive logging and robust error handling for reliability.

Getting Started

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/document-processing.git
cd document-processing
Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Build and push the Docker image:
bash
Copy code
# Authenticate Docker to your ECR registry
aws ecr get-login-password --region your-region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your-aws-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com

# Build Docker image
docker build -t document-processor .

# Tag Docker image
docker tag document-processor:latest your-aws-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/document-processor:latest

# Push Docker image to ECR
docker push your-aws-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/document-processor:latest
Deploy the application using AWS ECS and Fargate:
Create an ECS cluster and task definition.
Create a service and configure networking and auto-scaling as needed.
Usage

Web Interface: Access the application via the public IP address assigned by ECS. Use the web interface to upload documents and view processed results.
API: The application exposes endpoints to upload documents and retrieve processed data.
